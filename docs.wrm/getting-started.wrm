_section: Getting Started


_subsection: Installing

The various Classes and Functions are available to be imported
manually from sub-packages under the [@ethersproject](link-ethers-npm)
but for most projects, the umbrella package is the easiest way to
get started.

_code: @lang<shell>

/home/ricmoo> npm install --save ethers@next


_subsection: Importing

_heading: Node.js

_code: @lang<script>

// CommonJS
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

// ES6 or TypeScript
import { ethers } from "ethers";


_heading: Web Browser

It is generally better practice (for security reasons) to copy the
[ethers library](link-ethers-js) to your own webserver and serve it
yourself.

For quick demos or prototyping though, it can be loaded in your
Web Applications from our CDN.

_code: @lang<html>

<script src="https://cdn.ethers.io/lib/ethers-5.0.esm.min.js"
        type="application/javascipt"></script>
